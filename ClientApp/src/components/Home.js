        <br />I have handled team lead roles and software engineering roles. My
        main drive is to help make the people around me as efficient as
        possible. To build bridges between teams and applications so they can
        communicate more efficiently.

        Outside of my achievements, I'm a person trying to make a better world
        by teaching Shorinji Kempo to foster individuals with confidence in
        themselves, a kind listener, a patient friend that probably uses sarcasm
        way too much.
